## Project Description
There are many people who have the experience of using credit cards for consumption. This Yushan competition hopes to use the consumption records of past users to predict the categories that users will consume more in the next period. Therefore, we need to create a recommendation system to recommend the next period. The top three categories that each user is likely to spend the most on.

## Require packages
```shell
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run the code
```shell
python3 apps/training_apps.py
```
